# flexbox-landing-page-responsive
In this project, I have implemented the "flexbox" tool in order to be able to create layouts more easily in a unidirectional way within the landing page, without the need to use traditional CSS.

## Used technologies
* HTML
* CSS
  * Flexbox
  * Media Queries
* Netlify (deploy)

## Highlights

* I am applying the "order" property, which allows to change the position of the HTML elements without altering the HTML file itself.
* We make use of the flex grow and flex basis property to give a proportionality to the elements and so we can manage on our own how we want to grow and distribute the elements within a container. This I am applying it to the text elements together with the illustration.
